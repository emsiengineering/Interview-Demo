This repo is used for Front End Developer position interviews with the Career Coach Team.

The repo is built with `create-react-app`. In order to test it on `localhost:3000`, go to the root folder and run `npm i && npm start`.

The goal of the project is to display data stored in `src/data.json`, through a React web app such as the one shown in `mockup.png`. There is some minimalist starting code set up in `src/App.js`. Extra credit if you can improve the UI on top of mockup provided.
