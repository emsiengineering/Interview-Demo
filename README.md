This repo is used for Front End Developer position interviews with the Career Coach Team.

The goal of the project is to fetch data from College Scorecard API, and display the data in Front-End cards. The candidate will be responsible to set up React project themselves.

The repo contains different instructions/mockups for SE 1 and SE 2 levels. SE 2 contains an additional dropdown autosuggest select.

Note: This project is left at a place best for taking project mockup screenshots. So you shouldn't refer to the code specifically for SE 1/2 coding standards.
